## **About Mass Linkers**
Mass Linkers is a powerful Desktop application tool that helps **Computer Science (CS) students** find study support from batchmates, making it easier to form study groups and look for module-related guidance. 

It provides a **centralised** platform for CS students to 
- save their batchmates’ contact and module details  
- search for batchmates with common interests or who are taking similar modules **conveniently** 

It is optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## **Using the User Guide**
In this *User Guide*, we will take you through the many useful features and functions of Mass Linkers, and provide you crucial information on how the different commands are used.

We advise users to follow the User Guide sequentially as it provides a natural flow of how the sequence of commands should be executed.

## **Features**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  Example:
  * In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  Example:
  * `n/NAME t/TELEGRAM [i/INTEREST]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/johnxyz i/ai` or as `n/John Doe t/johnxyz` without using `i/INTEREST`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  Examples:
  * `[i/INTEREST]...` can be used as `i/ai`, `i/algo i/swe` etc.<br>
  * `[MORE_MODULES]...` can be used as `cs2100`, `cs2103t cs2101 cs2105` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  Example:
  * If the command specifies `n/NAME t/TELEGRAM [g/GITHUB] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [i/INTEREST]`, then `[i/INTEREST] [e/EMAIL] [p/PHONE] n/NAME [g/GITHUB] t/TELEGRAM` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
  Example:
  * If you specify `n/John Doe n/Bob Tan`, only `n/Bob Tan` will be saved.
  * If you specify `p/12341234` `p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be saved.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
  Example:
  * If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  * If the command specifies `exit 345`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about parameters:**<br>

* For all commands involving `INDEX`, `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.<br>
  * ___Beware!!!___ This may not be the full list of batchmates you have in Mass Linkers! For example, you may have entered the [find command](#find-a-batchmate-find), so the currently displayed list will be the result of `find` which is not the full list.
  * The index __must be a positive integer__, e.g. 1, 2, 3 … and be smaller than or equal to the number of batchmates in the currently displayed list.
  
</div>

### A. Batchmate commands
#### 1. Add a batchmate: `add`

Adds a batchmate to the list of batchmates in the _Students panel_.

__Format:__ `add n/NAME t/TELEGRAM [g/GITHUB] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [i/INTEREST]... [m/MODULE]...`

* A summary of the requirements of each parameter can be found under [Parameter Requirements](#parameter-requirements).
* Only unique batchmate can be added. It is considered a duplicate if an existing batchmate and the current batchmate to be added have identical Telegram handle, GitHub username, email address or phone number.
* Modules added to a batchmate will be automatically categorised according to their prefixes. e.g. `cs2103t` will be tagged as `Computer Science`.  `ma1521` will be tagged as `Mathematics`. For modules that are not identified by Mass Linkers, they will be tagged as `Unrestricted Elective`. More information can be found under [Module Categorisation](#module-categorisation).

__Examples:__
* `add n/John Doe t/johnxyz` adds a batchmate named `John Doe` with telegram handle `johnxyz` to the list.
* `add n/John Doe t/johnxyz g/johndoe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com i/ai i/swe` adds a batchmate named `John Doe` with telegram handle `johnxyz`, github username `johndoe`, phone number `98765432`, email address `johnd@example.com` and interests in `ai` and `swe` to the list.
* `add n/John Doe t/johnxyz m/cs2103t m/cs2101` adds a batchmate named `John Doe` with telegram handle `johnxyz` and modules `cs2103t` and `cs2101` to the list.

#### 2. Edit a batchmate: `edit`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
To edit a module, simply delete that module using [__mod delete__](#delete-module-from-a-batchmate-mod-delete) and add the new module using [__mod add__](#add-module-to-a-batchmate-mod-add).
</div>

* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st batchmate in the currently displayed list of the `find` command.

#### 4. Find a batchmate: `find`

Finds batchmates whose details contain __any__ of the given keywords.

__Format:__ `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

* `NAME`, `TELEGRAM`, `GITHUB`, `PHONE` and `EMAIL` are searched.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `Hans` will return `hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will return both `Hans Bo` and `Bo Hans`.
* To search using `NAME`, only __full words__ will be matched. e.g. `Ha` will _not_ return a batchmate with the name `Hans`.
* To search using `TELEGRAM`, `GITHUB`, `PHONE` and `EMAIL`, partial words are accepted. E.g. `boh` will return `bohans`.
* Batchmates matching at least one keyword will be returned. e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.

__Examples:__
* When you want to search using `NAME`:
  * `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`.
  * `find alex david` returns `Alex Tan`, `David Chua`.

### C. Module commands
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
Commands used to manage a batchmate's personal information in [Batchmate commands](#batchmate-commands) and [Interest commands](#interest-commands) follow the 1 command word syntax. E.g., `add`, `addInt`.
Whereas, commands that manage a module detail in [Module commands](#module-commands) can have multiple command words preceded by the `mod` keyword. E.g., `mod add`, `mod mark all`, `mod find taken`.

This is to facilitate easy distinction between the nature of commands.

## **FAQ**
#### Technical Support
**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install Mass Linkers in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Mass Linkers home folder.

**Q**: Do I need internet connection to use Mass Linkers?<br>
**A**: No, internet connection is not required. 

**Q**: I am using Mac and I tried opening the `MassLinkers.jar` file by double-clicking it in Finder. It says *"MassLinkers.jar" cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.*<br>
**A**: Right click the `MassLinkers.jar file` and select `Open`. When a warning message that says _macOS cannot verify the developer of "MassLinkers.jar". Are you sure you want to open it?_ appears, select `Open`. Alternatively, you can right click the `MassLinkers.jar` file and select `Open with JavaLauncher(default)`. 

**Q**: Will the data of batchmates be saved if the program was not closed via the ```exit``` command?<br>
**A**: Yes, the data will still be saved if the program is closed by closing the application window directly. However, we advise using the ```exit``` command for a better user experience.

**Q**: I have accidentally cleared all the data. Is there any way to undo the changes?<br>
**A**: Currently, there is no ```undo``` feature and the ```clear``` command is irreversible. Hence, it is extremely important to only use it when you want an empty Student and Module table. However, we are looking into adding ```undo``` and ```redo``` commands for future developments.

**Q**: I have added a batchmate and its row exceeds the currently displayed list of batchmates in the _Students panel_. I have to scroll below to view the newly added batchmate. Is this expected?<br>
**A**: Yes, adding a new batchmate would not auto scroll the _Students panel_ to the bottom of the list.

#### Privacy Issues
**Q**: What if I do not want to share some of my personal data like my phone number and email address?<br>
**A**: While it is every student's responsibility to exercise discretion in sharing their batchmates' contacts, Mass Linkers has made more sensitive data fields such as GitHub, Phone and Email optional. In this way, the only mandatory fields are your name and telegram handle. If you are uncomfortable sharing your name, you can use a pseudo-name for identification purposes.
