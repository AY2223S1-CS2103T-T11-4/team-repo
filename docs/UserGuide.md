Mass Linkers is a powerful Desktop application tool that enables CS2103T students in a tutorial group to search for their classmates, view their teammates’ repos and view each other’s code reviews. It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
