## **Using Mass Linkers: your quick start guide**

Welcome to Mass Linkers -- a powerful Desktop application tool that helps **Computer Science (CS) students** find study support from batchmates.

Mass Linkers helps you find batchmates to form study groups and seek study advice through the following way.

It provides a **centralised** platform for you to 
- save your batchmates’ contact and module details 
- search for batchmates with common interests or who are taking similar modules as you **conveniently**.

A fast typer? Mass Linkers is made just for you.
It is optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of an aesthetic **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

## **Using the User Guide**
In this *User Guide*, we will take you through the many useful features and functions of Mass Linkers, and provide you crucial information on how the different commands are used.

Feeling lost as a first-time user? We advise you to follow the User Guide sequentially, starting from [Getting started](#getting-started), as it provides a natural flow of how the commands should be executed.

If you are more familiar with CLI or Mass Linkers, head over to the [Command summary](#command-summary) to start using the app.

The following icons are used in the _User Guide_ to denote special information to look out for.

## **Features**
There are 4 main types of commands used in Mass Linkers - Batchmate commands, Interest commands, Module commands and General commands.

By segregating the commands in this manner, this makes it easier to make modifications and conduct a search based on different fields (ie. seach by common interests, modules or personal information).

The following notes outline several noteworthy format which the [Feature](#features) section uses in detailing the usage of different commands.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Take note of the Command Format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  Example:
  * In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  Example:
  * `n/NAME t/TELEGRAM [i/INTEREST]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/johnxyz i/ai` or as `n/John Doe t/johnxyz` without using `i/INTEREST`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  Examples:
  * `[i/INTEREST]...` can be used as `i/ai`, `i/algo i/swe` etc.<br>
  * `[MORE_MODULES]...` can be used as `cs2100`, `cs2103t cs2101 cs2105` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  Example:
  * If the command specifies `n/NAME t/TELEGRAM [g/GITHUB] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [i/INTEREST]`, then `[i/INTEREST] [e/EMAIL] [p/PHONE] n/NAME [g/GITHUB] t/TELEGRAM` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
  Example:
  * If you specify `n/John Doe n/Bob Tan`, only `n/Bob Tan` will be saved.
  * If you specify `p/12341234` `p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be saved.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) and `mod mark all` will be ignored.
  <br>Example:
  * If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  * If the command specifies `exit 345`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.
  * If the command specifies `mod mark all 123`, it will be interpreted as `mod mark all`.

</div>

Parameters are the input words that come after a command word to specify how the command should be executed. Click [here](#parameter-requirements) to view the list of parameter requirements.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Regarding parameters:**<br>

* For all commands involving `INDEX`, `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.<br>
  * ___Beware!!!___ This may not be the full list of batchmates you have in Mass Linkers! For example, you may have entered the [find command](#find-a-batchmate-find), so the currently displayed list will be the result of `find` which is not the full list.
  * The index __must be a positive integer__, e.g. 1, 2, 3 … and be smaller than or equal to the number of batchmates in the currently displayed list.
  
</div>

### A. Batchmate commands

Batchmate commands handle the management of a batchmate's personal information such as Name, Telegram, GitHub and Phone number.

#### 1. Add a batchmate: `add`

Adds a batchmate to the list of batchmates in the _Students panel_.

__Format:__ `add n/NAME t/TELEGRAM [g/GITHUB] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [i/INTEREST]... [m/MODULE]...`

* A summary of the requirements of each parameter can be found under [Parameter Requirements](#parameter-requirements).
* Only unique batchmate can be added. It is considered a duplicate if an existing batchmate and the current batchmate to be added have identical Telegram handle, GitHub username, email address or phone number.
* Modules added to a batchmate will be automatically categorised according to their prefixes. e.g. `cs2103t` will be tagged as `Computer Science`.  `ma1521` will be tagged as `Mathematics`. For modules that are not identified by Mass Linkers, they will be tagged as `Unrestricted Elective`. More information can be found under [Module Categorisation](#module-categorisation).

__Examples:__
* `add n/John Doe t/johnxyz` adds a batchmate named `John Doe` with telegram handle `johnxyz` to the list.
* `add n/John Doe t/johnxyz g/johndoe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com i/ai i/swe` adds a batchmate named `John Doe` with telegram handle `johnxyz`, github username `johndoe`, phone number `98765432`, email address `johnd@example.com` and interests in `ai` and `swe` to the list.
* `add n/John Doe t/johnxyz m/cs2103t m/cs2101` adds a batchmate named `John Doe` with telegram handle `johnxyz` and modules `cs2103t` and `cs2101` to the list.

#### 2. Edit a batchmate: `edit`

Edits the information of a specified batchmate in the _Students panel_.

__Format:__ `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [t/TELEGRAM] [g/GITHUB] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [i/INTEREST]...`

* Edits the batchmate at the specific `INDEX` in the __currently displayed list__ in the _Students panel_. Refer to the section on _Notes about parameters_ at the start of [Features](#features) for more details.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing interests, the existing interests of the batchmate will be completely replaced by the new ones.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can remove all batchmates’ interests by typing `i/` without specifying any interests after it.
</div>

__Examples:__
* `edit 1 g/johndoe p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the GitHub username, phone number and email address of the 1st batchmate in the currently displayed list to be `johndoe`, `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Bob Tan i/` edits the name of the 2nd batchmate in the currently displayed list to be `Bob Tan` and clears all existing interests.

#### 3. Delete a batchmate: `delete`

Deletes a specified batchmate from the _Students panel_.

__Format:__ `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the batchmate at the specific `INDEX` in the __currently displayed list__ in the _Students panel_. Refer to the section on _Notes about parameters_ at the start of [Features](#features) for more details.

__Examples:__
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd batchmate in the full list of batchmates you have in Mass Linkers.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st batchmate in the currently displayed list of the `find` command.

#### 4. Find a batchmate: `find`

Finds batchmates whose details contain __any__ of the given keywords.

__Format:__ `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

* `NAME`, `TELEGRAM`, `GITHUB`, `PHONE` and `EMAIL` are searched simultaneously.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `jOnAs` will return `Jonas`, `ivAn` will return `Ivan`.
* Finding by `NAME`:
  * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Ming Qing` will return both `Ming Qing` and `Qing Ming`.
  * Batchmates matching at least one keyword will be returned. e.g. `Ming Xuan` will return `Ming Qing`, `Yu Xuan`.
  * Only __full words__ will be matched. e.g. `Qin` will _not_ return a batchmate with the name `Qing`. You need to write `Qing`.
* Finding by `TELEGRAM`, `GITHUB`, `PHONE` and `EMAIL`:
  * Partial words are accepted. E.g. `uxu` will return `yuxuan`.
  * Unlike `NAME`, these items (`TELEGRAM`, `GITHUB`, `PHONE` and `EMAIL`) are not separated by spaces. If full words are needed for matching, you will have to type the full item out each time you search.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** 
`TELEGRAM`, `GITHUB`, `PHONE` and `EMAIL` are unique. if your partial text input is too common and list too many batchmates, simply type a few more letters! It is still better than typing the entire item!
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: find:**<br>
`find` command searches `NAME`, `TELEGRAM`, `GITHUB`, `PHONE` and `EMAIL` simultaneously.
</div>

__Examples:__
* When you want to search by `NAME`:
  * `find ming` returns `Ming`, `Ming Qing` and `Hong Ming`.
  * `find byron henry` returns `Byron Huang`, `Henry Chuah`.
* When you want to search by `TELEGRAM`, `GITHUB` or `EMAIL`:
  * `find ion` returns the batchmates with Telegram handle, GitHub username or email address containing `ion`, e.g. batchmate with telegram handle `liona`, batchmate with GitHub username `thecation47`.
* When you want to search by `PHONE`:
  * `find 999` returns the batchmates with phone number `69998888`, `89991234` or `99912345`.

#### 5. List all batchmates: `list`

Shows a list of all batchmates in the _Students panel_.

__Format:__ `list`

### B. Interest commands
Interest commands handle the management of a batchmate's list of interests, such as addition of interests, deletion of interests and searching batchmates with specified interests.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: What are considered interests:**<br>
Interests can include batchmates' hobbies such as games, CS specialisations, etc.
</div>

#### 1. Add interests: `addInt`

* `deleteInt 3 ai swe` deletes the interests `ai` and `swe` from the 3rd batchmate in the currently displayed list.

#### 3. Find batchmates by interests: `findInt`

Finds batchmates whose interests contain __all__ the specified interests.

__Format:__ `findInt INTEREST [MORE_INTERESTS]...`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `machineLearning` will match `machinelearning`.
* Only exact words will be matched. e.g. `sw` will not match `swe`.

__Examples:__
* `findInt ai` returns all batchmates whose interests contain `ai`.
* `findInt swe security` returns all batchmates whose interests contain both `swe` and `security`.

### C. Module commands
Module commands handle the management of a batchmate's list of modules, such as addition of modules, deletion of modules and searching batchmates with specified modules.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
Commands used to manage a batchmate's personal information in [Batchmate commands](#batchmate-commands) and [Interest commands](#interest-commands) follow the 1 command word syntax. E.g., `add`, `addInt`.
Whereas, commands that manage a module detail in [Module commands](#module-commands) can have multiple command words preceded by the `mod` keyword. E.g., `mod add`, `mod mark all`, `mod find taken`.

This is to facilitate easy distinction between the nature of commands.

</div>

#### 1. View a batchmate's modules
Views the list of modules taken by a batchmate in the Modules panel.

Left-click the row with the batchmate's name in the Students panel.

- The selected row would turn blue and the Modules panel would display all the modules of the batchmate.

### **Module Categorisation**

Modules are automatically categorised when you create them. The categorisation is modelled after the prefixes which [NUS modules](https://nusmods.com/modules?sem[0]=1&sem[1]=2&sem[2]=3&sem[3]=4) use.

Below is the categorisation:

| Category              | Module Prefix      |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Computer Science      | CS, IS, CP         |
| Mathematics           | ST, MA             |
| Science               | LS, CM, PC         |
| General Education     | GE, UT             |
| Unrestricted Elective | All other prefixes |

_Module prefix refers to the first two characters of every module name._

## **FAQ**
Facing an issue? Below are several commonly asked questions, which address technical and privacy concerns.

#### Technical Support
**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install Mass Linkers in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Mass Linkers home folder.

**Q**: Do I need internet connection to use Mass Linkers?<br>
**A**: No, internet connection is not required. 

<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Important for Mac users</span><br>
**Q**: I am using Mac and I tried opening the `MassLinkers.jar` file by double-clicking it in Finder. It says *"MassLinkers.jar" cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.*<br>
**A**: Right click the `MassLinkers.jar file` and select `Open`. When a warning message that says _macOS cannot verify the developer of "MassLinkers.jar". Are you sure you want to open it?_ appears, select `Open`. Alternatively, you can right click the `MassLinkers.jar` file and select `Open with JavaLauncher(default)`. 

**Q**: Will the data of batchmates be saved if the program was not closed via the ```exit``` command?<br>
**A**: Yes, the data will still be saved if the program is closed by closing the application window directly. However, we advise using the ```exit``` command for a better user experience.

**Q**: I have accidentally cleared all the data. Is there any way to undo the changes?<br>
**A**: Currently, there is no ```undo``` feature and the ```clear``` command is irreversible. Hence, it is extremely important to only use it when you want an empty Student and Module table. However, we are looking into adding ```undo``` and ```redo``` commands for future developments.

**Q**: I have added a batchmate and its row exceeds the currently displayed list of batchmates in the _Students panel_. I have to scroll below to view the newly added batchmate. Is this expected?<br>
**A**: Yes, adding a new batchmate would not auto scroll the _Students panel_ to the bottom of the list.

#### Privacy Issues
**Q**: What if I do not want to share some of my personal data like my phone number and email address?<br>
**A**: While it is every student's responsibility to exercise discretion in sharing their batchmates' contacts, Mass Linkers has made more sensitive data fields such as GitHub, Phone and Email optional. In this way, the only mandatory fields are your name and telegram handle. If you are uncomfortable sharing your name, you can use a pseudo-name for identification purposes.
