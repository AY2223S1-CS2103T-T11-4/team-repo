### Project: Mass Linkers
Mass Linkers is a powerful Desktop application tool that provides a centralised platform for Computer Science (CS) students to find study support from batchmates with common modules. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### New Enhancement: Refactored the GUI and its behavior
* What it does:
  * Displays the new user interface design.
  * Handles the interaction between the ```model``` and ```ui``` components.
* Justification: To improve user experience with an aesthetically pleasing UI.
* Highlights:
  * Implemented a UI overhaul, with its new design inspired by Outlook. 
  * Created module panel to display the modules taken by selected student. 
  * Handled live updates to UI for commands such as ```mod add```, ```mod mark``` and ```addInt```. 
  * Imported fonts to enhance style.
  * Added color-coded tags to modules. 
  * Handled rescaling of window size.
* Changes to Files Made:
  * The following ```.fxml``` files were created or updated to reflect design changes.
    * ```StudentListCard``` to show a student information details
    * ```StudentListPanel``` to list students
    * ```MainWindow``` for the overall layout of the application and to listen for real-time updates on Student and Mod panels
    * ```ModListCard``` to show details of a module
    * ```ModListPanel``` to list modules 
  * Their respective ```.java``` files were also refactored to make the application more dynamic to changes. 
  * The ```DarkTheme.css``` file was extensively refactored to update the UI interface.

#### New Feature: Add Interest
* What it does: Gives students a hassle-free way of adding new interests to a batchmate.
* Justification: It is crucial for students to be able to add interests without overwriting current interests.
* Highlights: 
  * Implemented ```AddInterestCommand``` which handles adding a set of interests to a student.
  * Implemented ```AddInterestParserCommand``` to parse ```addInt``` command arguments.
  * Wrote tests for ```AddInterestCommandTest``` and ```AddInterestParserCommandTest```.

#### Other Modifications: Modify Student Information
* What it does: Removes ```Address``` field and adds ```Telegram```and ```GitHub``` fields to a student.
* Justification: Since Mass Linkers serves as a CS contact-sharing platform, it would be a value-add to include relevant socials to a batchmate.
* Highlights:
    * Added private ```Telegram``` and ```GitHub``` fields to ```Student```.
    * Created ```Telegram``` and ```GitHub``` classes to handle parsed inputs and display formatting.
    * Redesigned user interface of ```Student``` fields such as addition of GitHub and Telegram logos.
    * Made relevant amendments to ```StudentTest``` tests.
    * Wrote tests for ```GitHubTest``` and ```TelegramTest```.
