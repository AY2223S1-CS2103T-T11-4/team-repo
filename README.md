* Mass Linkers is a powerful Desktop application tool that provides a centralised platform for Computer Science (CS) students to find study support from batchmates with common modules.<br>
  Example usage:
  * save your CS batchmatesâ€™ contact details in one place
  * find common modules and form study groups
* It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the [Mass Linkers Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-t11-4.github.io/tp/)
* _This project is based on the MassLinkers-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)._
