## About
* Mass Linkers is a powerful Desktop application tool that provides a centralised platform for Computer Science (CS) students to find study support from batchmates with common modules.<br>
  Example usage:
  * save your CS batchmatesâ€™ contact details in one place
  * find common modules and form study groups
* It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
