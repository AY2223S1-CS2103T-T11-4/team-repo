## About
* Mass Linkers is a powerful Desktop application tool that helps Computer Science (CS) students find study support from batchmates, making it easier to form study groups and look for module-related guidance.<br>
  Example usage:
  * save your CS batchmatesâ€™ module and contact details
  * search for batchmates with common interests or who are taking similar modules
* It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
