* Mass Linkers is a powerful Desktop application tool that enables CS2103T students in a tutorial group to search for their classmates, view their teammates’ repos and view each other’s code reviews.<br>
  Example usage:
  * as a helper tool to view classmates' repos and code reviews for self-learning
* It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* _This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)._
